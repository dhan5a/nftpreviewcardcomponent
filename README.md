## Overview

I built a responsive NFT preview card component, utilising HTML5 and CSS3. 

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned

I learnt how to make a responsive component, even though it wasn't required for this challenge. 

I learnt especially how margin:auto works. This syntax is useful for accomodating different browser sizes.
