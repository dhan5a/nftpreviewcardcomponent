## Overview

I built a responsive NFT preview card component, utilising HTML5 and CSS3. 

Some things to note:

Compared to the design, I think I got the font-sizes wrong.

Also, I wasn't able to use the root values for colours and used the hsl values in the code instead.

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned

I learnt how to make a responsive component, even though it wasn't required for this challenge. 

I learnt especially how margin:auto works. This syntax is useful for accomodating different browser sizes.
